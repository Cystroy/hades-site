        <h1> Stygian Blade </h1>
        <p>'...Stygius, the Blade of the Underworld, must have been among the finest weapons ever wielded, back when it was whole. Back when the six elder gods sealed the Titans in the deepest recesses of Tartarus, that blade evidently played no small role in their success. It must have been Lord Poseidon who brandished that blade before he opted for that trident he so likes. Now the blade lies broken, survived only by its burning soul. I knew that Master Hades would pay little heed if I provided all the shattered remnants of the thing to his own son, who naturally was able to reconstitute them into something more than functional, indeed. It has been long since last the blade had a partner, and as I transported it, I could sense its eagerness to return to battle; to relive its own memories. I am left to wonder, who else shall someday bear this blade? The Master's son, among his charitable qualities, isn't warlike enough to want to use it forever.' </p>
